INTRODUCTION\\n\\n# 1.1 What is the meaning of tax?\\n\\nLet us begin by understanding the meaning of tax. Article 366(28) of the Constitution of India defines the term “Taxation” as follows – “Taxation includes the imposition of any tax or impost, whether general or local or special, and tax shall be construed accordingly.\"\\n\\nTaxes are considered to be the “cost of living in a society”. Taxes are levied by the Governments to meet the common welfare expenditure of the society. There are two types of taxes - direct taxes and indirect taxes.\\n\\n# Direct Taxes:\\n\\nIf tax is levied directly on the income or wealth of a person, then, it is a direct tax. The person who pays the tax to the Government cannot recover it from somebody else i.e. the burden of a direct tax cannot be shifted. E.g., Income-tax.\\n\\n# Indirect Taxes:\\n\\nIf tax is levied on the price of a good or service, then, it is an indirect tax e.g. Goods and Services Tax (GST) or Custom Duty. In the case of indirect taxes, the person paying the tax passes on the incidence to another person.\\n\\n|TYPE OF TAXES|DIRECT TAXES|INDIRECT TAXES|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|INCOME TAX|TAX ON UNDISCLOSED FOREIGN INCOME AND ASSETS|GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST)|\\n| | |CUSTOMS DUTY|\\n\\n# 1.2 Why are taxes levied?\\n\\nThe reason for levy of taxes is that they constitute the basic source of revenue to the Government.

The Parliament and State Legislatures are empowered to make laws on the matters enumerated in the Seventh Schedule by virtue of Article 246 of the Constitution of India.\\n\\nSeventh Schedule to Article 246 contains three lists which enumerate the matters under which the Parliament and the State Legislatures have the authority to make laws for the purpose of levy of taxes.\\n\\nThe following are the lists:\\n\\n- (i) Union List: Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws on the matters contained in Union List.\\n- (ii) State List: The Legislatures of any State has the exclusive power to make laws on the matters contained in the State List.\\n- (iii) Concurrent List: Both Parliament and State Legislatures have the power to make laws on the matters contained in the Concurrent list.\\n\\nIncome-tax is the most significant direct tax. Entry 82 of the Union List i.e., List I in the Seventh Schedule to Article 246 of the Constitution of India has given the power to the Parliament to make laws on taxes on income other than agricultural income.\\n\\n# 1.4 Overview of Income-tax law in India\\n\\nIn this material, we would be introducing the students to the Income-tax law in India.

Clause (1A) defines “agricultural income”, clause (1B) defines “amalgamation” and so on. Each one of them is independent of other clause of the same section.\\n- Likewise, the clauses of section 10 contain the exemptions in respect of certain income, like clause (1) provides for exemption of agricultural income and clause (2) provides for exemption of share income of a member of a Hindu Undivided Family and so on.\\n- Section 5 defining the scope of total income has two sub-sections (1) and (2). Sub-section (1) defines the scope of total income of a resident and sub-section (2) defines the scope of total income of a non-resident. Each sub section is related with the other in the sense that only when one reads them all, one gets the complete idea related with scope of total income.\\n\\nA section may also have Provisos and Explanations.\\n\\n- The Proviso(s) to a section/sub-section/clause spells out the exception(s)/ condition(s) to the provision contained in the respective section/ sub-section/ clause, i.e., the proviso spells out the cases where the provision contained in the respective section/ sub-section/ clause would not apply or where the provision would apply with certain modification.\\n- The Explanation to a section/ sub-section/ clause gives a clarification relating to the provision contained in the respective section/ sub-section/ clause.\\n\\n- Example\\n- Sections 80GGB and 80GGC provides for deduction from gross total income in respect of contributions made by companies and other persons, respectively, to political parties or an electoral trust.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='e0680cf2-26eb-4902-9459-23f4b9acc4b3', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'D:\\\\finance_rag\\\\test_1_pdf\\\\74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_name': '74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 993792, 'creation_date': '2025-04-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-04-18'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# 1.8 INCOME TAX LAW\\n\\nThe proviso to sections 80GGB and 80GGC provide that no deduction shall be allowed under those sections in respect of any sum contributed by cash to political parties or an electoral trust.

Thus, the Explanation clarifies that the political party has to be a registered political party.\\n\\nThe Income-tax Act, 1961 undergoes change every year with additions and substitutions brought in by the Annual Finance Act passed by Parliament. Sometimes, the Income-tax Act, 1961 is also amended through other legislations like Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act.\\n\\n# The Finance Act\\n\\nEvery year, the Finance Minister of the Government of India introduces the Finance Bill in the Parliament’s Budget Session. When the Finance Bill is passed by both the houses of the Parliament and gets the assent of the President, it becomes the Finance Act.

The residential status as per the Income-tax Act, 1961 can be classified as under –\\n\\n# RESIDENTIAL STATUS UNDER THE INCOME TAX ACT, 1961\\n\\n|RESIDENT|DEEMED RESIDENT|NON-RESIDENT|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|RESIDENT AND ORDINARILY RESIDENT|RESIDENT BUT NOT ORDINARILY RESIDENT| |\\n\\nIn the case of an individual, the duration for which he is present in India in the relevant previous year or relevant previous year and the earlier previous years determines his residential status. Based on the days spent by him in India, he may be (a) resident and ordinarily resident, (b) resident but not ordinarily resident, or (c) non-resident.\\n\\nThe residential status of a person determines the taxability of the income. For e.g., income earned and received outside India will not be taxable in the hands of a non-resident but will be taxable in case of a resident and ordinarily resident.\\n\\nThere is also a concept of deemed resident for which presence of individual in India is not required. A deemed resident is always a resident but not ordinarily resident in India. Determination of residential status has been discussed in Chapter 2.\\n\\nStep 2 – Classification of income under different heads\\n\\nA person may earn income from different sources. For example, a salaried person earns income by way of salary. He also gets interest from bank savings account/fixed deposit. Apart from this, if he has invested in shares, he would be getting dividend and when he sells these shares, he may earn profit on such sale. If he owns a residential property which he has let out, he would earn rental income.\\n\\nUnder the Income-tax Act, 1961, for computation of total income, all income of a tax payer are classified into five different heads of income.

These heads of income exhaust all possible types of income that can accrue to or be received by the tax payer. Accordingly, income earned is classified as follows:\\n\\n1. Salary, pension etc. earned is taxable under the head “Salaries”.\\n2. Rental income is taxable under the head “Income from house property”.\\n3. Income derived from carrying on any business or profession is taxable under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”.\\n4. Profit from sale of a capital asset (like land, building and shares) is taxable under the head “Capital Gains”.\\n5. The fifth head of income is the residuary head. Income which is chargeable to tax under the Income-tax Act, 1961 but not taxable under the first four heads will be taxed under the head “Income from other sources”.\\n\\nThe tax payer has to classify the income earned under the relevant head of income.\\n\\n# Step 3 – Computation of income under each head\\n\\nIncome is to be computed in accordance with the provisions governing a particular head of income.\\n\\n# Exemptions:\\n\\nThere are certain incomes which are wholly exempt from income-tax e.g., agricultural income.

Similarly, deductions and allowances are prescribed under other heads of income. These deductions etc. have to be considered before arriving at the net income chargeable under each head.\\n\\nThese exemptions and deductions would be available to the individual depending upon the regime in which he pays tax. Tax regime under section 115BAC is the default tax regime which provides for concessional rates of tax to individuals/HUFs/AoPs/BoIs/Artificial juridical persons. However, certain exemptions and deductions are not allowed under the default tax regime. Such assessees have an option to opt out of the said regime and pay tax under normal provisions of the Act. These tax regimes i.e., the default tax regime under section 115BAC and optional tax regime under the normal provisions of the Act are discussed in detail later on in this Chapter.\\n\\nFor detailed discussion on exemptions and deductions under each head, refer to Chapter 3: Heads of Income.\\n\\n# Disallowance of expenditure in relation to exempt income [Section 14A]\\n\\n- As per section 14A, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, expenditure incurred in relation to any exempt income is not allowed as a deduction while computing income under any of the five heads of income.\\n- The Assessing Officer is empowered to determine the amount of expenditure incurred in relation to such income which does not form part of total income in accordance with such method as may be prescribed.\\n- The method for determining expenditure in relation to exempt income for the purpose of disallowance of such expenditure under section 14A is prescribed by the CBDT.\\n- The provisions of section 14A regarding disallowance of expenses would apply even in a case where exempt income has not accrued or arisen or has not been received during the previous year relevant to an assessment year and the expenditure has been incurred during the said previous year in relation to such exempt income.\\n\\n# Step 4 – Clubbing of income of spouse, minor child etc.\\n\\nIn case of individuals, income-tax is levied on a slab system on the total income.

Some taxpayers in the higher income bracket have a tendency to divert some portion of their income to their spouse, minor child etc. to minimize their tax burden.\\n\\nIn order to prevent such tax avoidance, clubbing provisions have been incorporated in the Act, under which income arising to certain persons (like spouse, minor child etc.) have to be included in the income of the person who has diverted his income for the purpose of computing tax liability. For detailed discussion, refer to Chapter 4: Income of other persons included in assessee’s total income.\\n\\n# Step 5 – Set-off or carry forward and set-off of losses\\n\\nAn assessee may have different sources of income under the same head of income. He may have profit from one source and loss from the other. For instance, an assessee may have profit from his textile business and loss from his printing business. This loss can be set-off against the profits of textile business to arrive at the net income chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”.\\n\\nSimilarly, an assessee can have loss under one head of income, say, profits and gains of business or profession and profits under another heads of income, say, income from house property. There are provisions in the Income-tax Act, 1961 for allowing inter-head adjustment in certain cases.\\n\\nHowever, there are also restrictions in certain cases, like business loss is not allowed to be set-off against salary income. Default tax regime under section 115BAC puts further more restrictions like loss from house property cannot be set off from income under any other head. Further, losses which cannot be set-off in the current year due to inadequacy of eligible profits can be carried forward for set-off in the subsequent years as per the provisions contained in the Act. Generally, brought forward losses under a particular head cannot be set-off against income under another head i.e., brought forward business loss cannot be set-off against income from house property of the current year. For detailed discussion, refer to Chapter 5: Aggregation of income, set-off and carry forward of losses.\\n\\n# Step 6 – Computation of Gross Total Income\\n\\nThe final figures of income or loss under each head of income, after allowing the eligible deductions, allowances and other adjustments, are then aggregated, after giving effect to the provisions for clubbing of income and set-off and carry forward of losses, to arrive at the gross total income.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='c0b05306-cd64-451e-ac3e-a11e297b1878', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'D:\\\\finance_rag\\\\test_1_pdf\\\\74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_name': '74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 993792, 'creation_date': '2025-04-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-04-18'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# BASIC CONCEPTS\\n\\n# 1.15 a\\n\\n# Step 7 – Deductions from Gross Total Income\\n\\nThere are deductions prescribed from Gross Total Income.

Under this regime certain exemptions/deductions are, however, not available like Leave Travel Concession, interest on housing loan on self-occupied property, deductions under Chapter VI-A [other than section 80CCD(2), 80CCH(2) or section 80JJAA] etc. The rates given under section 115BAC are the default tax rates unless the assessee exercises an option to shift out of the said regime. The basic exemption limit under section 115BAC is ` 3,00,000. This means that no tax is payable by an assessee with total income of upto ` 3,00,000. The tax rates under section 115BAC is as follows -\\n\\n|S. No.|Total Income|Rate of tax|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|1.|Upto ` 3,00,000|Nil|\\n|2.|From ` 3,00,000 to ` 6,00,000|5%|\\n|3.|From ` 6,00,000 to ` 9,00,000|10%|\\n|4.|From ` 9,00,000 to ` 12,00,000|15%|\\n|5.|From ` 12,00,000 to ` 15,00,000|20%|\\n|6.|Above ` 15,00,000|30%|\\n\\nRates prescribed by the Annual Finance Act under the optional tax regime\\n\\nIndividuals/HUF/AoPs/BoIs and artificial juridical persons, who exercise the option to opt out of the default tax regime under section 115BAC, have to pay tax as per normal provisions of the Act. Under the normal provisions of the Act, the rates of tax are prescribed by the Annual Finance Act of the year.\\n\\nFor individuals, HUF etc., the basic exemption limit is ` 2,50,000. This means that, as per the normal provisions of the Act, no tax is payable by individuals with total income of upto ` 2,50,000. Those individuals whose total income is more than ` 2,50,000 but less than ` 5,00,000 have to pay tax on their total income in excess of ` 2,50,000@5%. Total income between ` 5,00,000 and ` 10,00,000 attracts tax @20%. The highest rate is 30%, which is attracted in respect of income in excess of ` 10,00,000.

These incomes are taxable at special rates of taxation under both the tax regimes. These special rates are contained in the Income-tax Act, 1961 itself.\\n\\n# Step 10 - Surcharge / Rebate under section 87A\\n\\nSurcharge: Surcharge is an additional tax payable over and above the income-tax. Surcharge is levied as a percentage of income-tax, where total income exceeds ` 50 lakhs. The rates of surcharge applicable for different slabs of total income are discussed later on in this chapter.\\n\\nRebate under section 87A: In order to provide tax relief to the individual tax payers, section 87A provides a rebate from the tax payable by an assessee, being an individual resident in India, whose total income does not exceed ` 7,00,000 under the default tax regime under section 115BAC or ` 5,00,000 under the normal provisions of the Act if he opts out of the default tax regime. Under the default tax regime, an individual whose total income exceeds ` 7 lakhs marginally is also entitled to a rebate of the difference between tax on total income and the amount by which the total income exceeds ` 7 lakhs, when the former is greater than the latter.\\n\\n# Step 11 – Health and education cess on income-tax\\n\\nThe income-tax, as increased by the surcharge or as reduced by the rebate under section 87A, if applicable, is to be further increased by an additional surcharge called health and education cess on income-tax @4% of income-tax plus surcharge, if applicable.\\n\\n# Step 12 – Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT)\\n\\nThe Income-tax Act, 1961 contains certain profit-linked and investment linked deductions under normal provisions of the Act to promote investment in various sectors. These tax benefits help to reduce the tax liability of the taxpayers who exercise the option to opt out of the default tax regime under section 115BAC and become eligible to claim such deductions. In order to preserve the tax base vis-a-vis profit linked and investment linked deductions, the Income-tax Act, 1961 provides for levy of alternate minimum tax.

Then, such persons can determine which is more beneficial and accordingly decide whether or not to opt out of the default tax regime under section 115BAC.\\n\\nIndividuals/HUF/AoPs/BoIs not having income from business or profession can choose whether or not to exercise the option of shifting out of the default tax regime in each previous year. They may choose to pay tax under default tax regime under section 115BAC in one year and exercise the option to shift out of default tax regime in another year.\\n\\n# Step 14 – Advance tax and tax deducted/ collected at source\\n\\nAlthough the tax liability of an assessee is determined only at the end of the year, tax is required to be paid in advance in four installments on the basis of estimated income i.e., on or before 15ᵗʰ June, 15ᵗʰ September, 15ᵗʰ December and 15ᵗʰ March.\\n\\nHowever, residents declaring profits under presumptive taxation scheme (where business income is computed as a percentage of gross receipts/turnover) can pay advance tax in one installment on or before 15ᵗʰ March instead of four installments.\\n\\nIn certain cases, tax is required to be deducted at source from the income by the payer at the rates prescribed in the Income-tax Act, 1961 or the Annual Finance Act.

Such tax deducted at source has to be remitted to the credit of the Central Government through any branch of the RBI, SBI or any authorized bank within the statutory due dates. For detailed discussion, refer to Chapter 7: Advance tax, tax deduction at source and tax collection at source.\\n\\n# Step 15: Tax Payable/Tax Refundable\\n\\nAfter adjusting the advance tax and tax deducted/ collected at source, the assessee would arrive at the amount of net tax payable or refundable. Such amount should be rounded off to the nearest multiple of ` 10 as per section 288B. The assessee has to pay the amount of tax payable (called self-assessment tax) on or before the due date of filing of the return. Similarly, if any refund is due, assessee will get the same after filing the return of income.\\n\\n# (2) Return of Income\\n\\nThe Income-tax Act, 1961 contains provisions for filing of return of income. Return of income is the format in which the assessee furnishes information as to his total income and tax payable. The format for filing of returns by different assessees is notified by the CBDT. The particulars of income earned under different heads, gross total income, deductions from gross total income, total income and tax payable by the assessee are required to be furnished in the return of income. In short, a return of income is the declaration of income by the assessee in the prescribed format. The Act has prescribed due dates for filing return of income in case of different assessees. Companies and firms have to mandatorily file their return of income before the due date. Other assessees are required to file a return of income subject to fulfilling of certain conditions.\\n\\n# 3.

The levy of income-tax is on “every person”. Therefore, income-tax is payable by a HUF.\\n\\n\"Hindu undivided family\" has not been defined under the Income-tax Act. The expression is, however, defined under the Hindu Law as a family, which consists of all males lineally descended from a common ancestor and includes their wives and daughters.\\n\\nSome members of the HUF are called co-parceners. They are related to each other and to the head of the family. HUF may contain many members, but members within four degrees including the head of the family (Karta) are called co-parceners.\\n\\nA Hindu Coparcenary includes those persons who acquire an interest in joint family property by birth. Earlier, only male descendants were considered as coparceners. With effect from 6ᵗʰ September, 2005, daughters have also been accorded coparcenary status. It may be noted that only the coparceners have a right to partition.\\n\\nA daughter of coparcener by birth shall become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as the son. Being a coparcener, she can claim partition of assets of the family. The rights of a daughter in coparcenary property are equal to that of a son. However, other female members of the family, for example, wife or daughter-in-law of a coparcener are not eligible for such coparcenary rights.\\n\\nThe relation of a HUF does not arise from a contract but arises from status. There need not be more than one male member or one female coparcener w.e.f. 6ᵗʰ September, 2005 to form a HUF. The Income-tax Act, 1961 also does not indicate that a HUF as an assessable entity must consist of at least two male members or two coparceners.\\n\\nUnder the Income-tax Act, 1961, Jain undivided families and Sikh undivided families would also be assessed as a HUF.\\n\\n# Schools of Hindu Law\\n\\n|Dayabaga school|Mitakshara school|\\n|---|---|\\n|West Bengal and Assam|Rest of India except West Bengal and Assam|\\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='cc04db03-7bb0-448d-be24-b46a3cc20902', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'D:\\\\finance_rag\\\\test_1_pdf\\\\74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_name': '74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 993792, 'creation_date': '2025-04-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-04-18'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# 1.24 INCOME TAX LAW\\n\\nThe basic difference between the two schools of Hindu law with regard to succession is as follows:\\n\\n|Dayabaga school of Hindu law|Mitakshara school of Hindu law|\\n|---|---|\\n|Prevalent in West Bengal and Assam|Prevalent in rest of India|\\n|Nobody acquires the right, share in the property by birth as long as the head of family is living.|One acquires the right to the family property by his birth and not by succession irrespective of the fact that his elders are living.|\\n|Thus, the children do not acquire any right, share in the family property, as long as his father is alive and only on death of the father, the children will acquire right/share in the property.|Thus, every child born in the family acquires a right/share in the family property.|\\n|Hence, the father and his brothers would be the coparceners of the HUF.| |\\n\\n# (iii) Company [Section 2(17)]\\n\\nFor all purposes of the Act, the term ‘Company’, has a much wider connotation than that under the Companies Act.

Capital receipts are generally not included within the scope of income in general parlance. However, the Income-tax Act, 1961 has specifically included certain capital receipts within the definition of income e.g., Capital gains i.e., gains on sale of a capital assets like land, jewellery.\\n- Net receipt vis-a-vis Gross receipt: Income means net receipts and not gross receipts. Net receipts are arrived at after deducting the expenditure incurred in connection with earning such receipts. The expenditure which can be deducted while computing income under each head is prescribed under the Income-tax Act, 1961. Income from certain eligible businesses/professions is also determined on presumptive basis i.e., as a certain percentage of gross receipts. [We will discuss in detail in Unit 3 of Chapter 3: Profits and gains of business or profession].\\n- Due basis vis-a-vis receipt basis: Income is taxable either on due basis or receipt basis. For computing income under the heads “Profits and gains of business or profession” and “Income from other sources”, the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee should be considered, which can be either cash system or mercantile system. Some receipts are taxable only on receipt basis, like, income by way of interest received on compensation or enhanced compensation.\\n- Application of Income vis-a-vis Diversion of Income: Application of income means to discharge an obligation (which is gratuitous or self-imposed) after such income reaches the assessee. Where by virtue of an obligation by overriding title, income is diverted before it reaches the assessee, it is known as diversion of income.

The concept of revenue and capital receipts is discussed hereunder -\\n\\nThe Act contemplates a levy of tax on income and not on capital and hence it is very essential to distinguish between capital and revenue receipts. Capital receipts cannot be taxed, unless they fall within the scope of the definition of “income” and so the distinction between capital and revenue receipts is material for tax purposes. Certain capital receipts which have been specifically included in the definition of income are compensation for modification or termination of services, income by way of capital gains etc.\\n\\nIt is not possible to lay down any single test as infallible or any single criterion as decisive, final and universal in application to determine whether a particular receipt is capital or revenue in nature. Hence, the capital or revenue nature of the receipt must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances of each case.\\n\\n# Criteria for determining whether a receipt is capital or revenue in nature\\n\\nThe following are some of the important criteria which may be applied to distinguish between capital and revenue receipts.\\n\\n# Fixed capital or Circulating capital:\\n\\nA receipt referable to fixed capital would be a capital receipt whereas a receipt referable to circulating capital would be a revenue receipt. The former is not taxable while the latter is taxable. Tangible and intangible assets which the owner keeps in his possession for making profits are in the nature of fixed capital. The circulating capital is one which is turned over and yields income or loss in the process.\\n\\n# Income from transfer of capital asset or trading asset:\\n\\nProfits arising from the sale of a capital asset are chargeable to tax as capital gains under section 45 whereas profits arising from the sale of a trading asset being of revenue nature are taxable as income from business under section 28 provided that the sale is in the regular course of assessee’s business or the transaction constitutes an adventure in the nature of trade.\\n\\n# Capital Receipts vis-a-vis Revenue Receipts: Tests to be applied\\n\\n1. Transaction entered into the course of business: Profits arising from transactions which are entered into in the course of the business regularly carried on by the assessee, or are incidental to, or associated with the business of the assessee would be revenue receipts chargeable to tax.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='f441d155-9a02-44c2-a309-e55e44b17149', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'D:\\\\finance_rag\\\\test_1_pdf\\\\74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_name': '74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 993792, 'creation_date': '2025-04-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-04-18'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# BASIC CONCEPTS\\n\\nExample: A banker’s or financier’s dealings in foreign exchange or sale of shares and securities, a shipbroker’s purchase of ship in his own name, a share broker’s purchase of shares on his own account would constitute transactions entered and yielding income in the ordinary course of their business. Whereas building and land would constitute capital assets in the hands of a trader in shares, the same would constitute stock-in-trade in the hands of a property dealer.\\n\\n# (2) Profit arising from sale of shares and securities:\\n\\nIn the case of profit arising from the sale of shares and securities, the nature of the profit has to be ascertained from the motive, intention or purpose with which they were bought. If the shares were acquired as an investor or with a view to acquiring a controlling interest or for obtaining a managing or selling agency or a directorship, the profit or loss on their sale would be of a capital nature; but if the shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business as a dealer in shares, it would constitute his stock-in-trade. If the shares were acquired with speculative motive, the profit or loss (although of a revenue nature) would have to be dealt with separately from the profit or loss of other businesses.\\n\\nSecurities held by Foreign Institutional Investor which has invested in such securities in accordance with the regulations made under the SEBI Act, 1992 would be treated as a capital asset. Even if the nature of such security in the hands of the Foreign Portfolio Investor is stock-in-trade, the same would be treated as a capital asset and the profit on transfer would be taxable as capital gains.\\n\\n# (3) A single transaction - Can it constitute business?\\n\\nEven a single transaction may constitute a business or an adventure in the nature of trade even if it is outside the normal course of the assessee’s business. Repetition of such transactions is not necessary. Thus, a bulk purchase followed by a bulk sale or a series of retail sales or bulk sale followed by a series of retail purchases would constitute an adventure in the nature of trade and consequently, the income arising therefrom would be taxable. Purchase of any article with no intention to resell it, but resold under changed circumstances would be a transaction of a capital nature and capital gains would arise. However, where an asset is purchased with the intention to resell it, the question whether the profit on sale is capital or revenue in nature depends upon (i) the conduct of the assessee, (ii) the nature and quantity of the article purchased, (iii) the nature of the operations involved, (iv) whether the venture is on capital or revenue account, and (v) other related circumstances of the case.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='d15eb63b-3779-489e-8474-448a8a63467a', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'D:\\\\finance_rag\\\\test_1_pdf\\\\74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_name': '74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 993792, 'creation_date': '2025-04-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-04-18'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text=\"# INCOME TAX LAW\\n\\n# 1.34\\n\\n# (4) Liquidated damages:\\n\\nReceipt of liquidated damages directly and intimately linked with the procurement of a capital asset, which lead to delay in coming into existence of the profit-making apparatus, is a capital receipt. The amount received by the assessee towards compensation for sterilization of the profit earning source is not in the ordinary course of business. Hence, it is a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee.\\n\\n# (5) Compensation on termination of agency/service contract:\\n\\nWhere an assessee receives compensation on termination of the agency business being the only source of income, the receipt is of capital nature, but taxable under section 28(ii)(c). However, where the assessee has a number of agencies and one of them is terminated and compensation is received therefor, the receipt would be of a revenue nature since taking up an agency and exploiting the same for earning income is in the ordinary course of business. The loss of one agency would be made good by profit from another agency. Compensation received from the employer or from any person for premature termination of the service contract is a capital receipt, but is taxable as profit in lieu of salary under section 17(3) or as income from other sources under section 56(2)(xi), respectively. Compensation received or receivable in connection with the termination or the modification of the terms and conditions of any contract relating to its business shall be taxable as business income.\\n\\n# (6) Gifts:\\n\\nNormally, gifts constitute a capital receipt in the hands of the recipient. However, certain gifts are brought within the purview of income-tax, for example, receipt of property without consideration is brought to tax under section 56(2)(x). For example, any sum of money or value of property received without consideration or for inadequate consideration by any person, other than a relative, is chargeable under the head “Income from Other Sources” [For details, refer to Unit - 5 of Chapter 3 :Income from Other Sources].\\n\\n# 3.5 India [Section 2(25A)]\\n\\nThe term 'India' means –\\n\\n- (i) the territory of India as per Article 1 of the Constitution,\\n- (ii) its territorial waters, seabed and subsoil underlying such waters,\\n- (iii) continental shelf,\\n- (iv) exclusive economic zone or\", path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='87692b36-a2ff-4843-ba1b-122ae2189f9a', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'D:\\\\finance_rag\\\\test_1_pdf\\\\74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_name': '74792bos60498-cp1.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 993792, 'creation_date': '2025-04-19', 'last_modified_date': '2025-04-18'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='# BASIC CONCEPTS\\n\\n(v) any other specified maritime zone and the air space above its territory and territorial waters.\\n\\nSpecified maritime zone means the maritime zone as referred to in the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and other Maritime Zones Act, 1976.\\n\\n# 3.6 Agricultural income [Section 2(1A)]\\n\\nAgricultural income definition is very wide and covers the income of not only the cultivators but also the land holders who might have rented out the lands.

It may be rent or revenue derived from land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes.\\n2. It may be income derived from such land by\\n1. agriculture or\\n2. the performance of a process ordinarily employed by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind to render the produce fit to be taken to the market or\\n3. the sale, by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind, of such agricultural produce raised or received by him, in respect of which no process has been performed other than a process of the nature mentioned in point (b) above.\\n3. Lastly, agricultural income may be derived from any farm building required for agricultural operations.\\n\\nNow let us take a critical look at the following aspects:\\n\\n1. Rent or revenue derived from land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes: The following three conditions have to be satisfied for income to be treated as agricultural income:\\n1.

The rent can either be received by the owner of the land or by the original tenant from the sub-tenant. It implies that ownership of land is not necessary. Thus, the rent received by the original tenant from sub-tenant would also be agricultural income subject to the other conditions mentioned above.\\n\\nThe scope of the term “Revenue” is much broader than rent. It includes income other than rent. For example, fees received for renewal for grant of land on lease would be revenue derived from land.\\n\\n# (2) Income derived from such land by\\n\\n# (a) Agriculture\\n\\nThe term “Agriculture” has not been defined in the Act.

The income from the process employed to render the produce fit to be taken to the market would be agricultural income. However, it must be a process ordinarily employed by the cultivator or receiver of rent in kind and the process must be applied to make the produce fit to be taken to the market.\\n\\nThe ordinary process employed to render the produce fit to be taken to market includes thrashing, winnowing, cleaning, drying, crushing etc. For example, the process ordinarily employed by the cultivator to obtain the rice from paddy is to first remove the hay from the basic grain, and thereafter to remove the chaff from the grain. The grain has to be properly filtered to remove stones etc. and finally the rice has to be packed in gunny bags for sale in the market.\\n\\nAfter such process, the rice can be taken to the market for sale. This process of making the rice ready for the market may involve manual operations or mechanical operations. All these operations constitute the process ordinarily employed to make the product fit for the market. The produce must retain its original character in spite of the processing unless there is no market for selling it in that condition.\\n\\nHowever, if marketing process is performed on a produce which can be sold in its raw form, income derived therefrom is partly agricultural income and partly business income.\\n\\n# (c) Sale of such agricultural produce in the market:\\n\\nAny income from the sale of any produce to the cultivator or receiver of rent-in kind is agricultural income provided it is from the land situated in India and used for agricultural purposes.

However, a method has been laid down to levy tax on agricultural income in an indirect way. This concept is known as partial integration of agricultural income with non-agricultural income. It is applicable to individuals, HUF, AOPs, BOIs and artificial juridical persons. Two conditions which need to be satisfied for partial integration are:\\n\\n1. The net agricultural income should exceed ` 5,000 p.a., and\\n2. Non-agricultural income should exceed the maximum amount not chargeable to tax. (i.e., If such person is paying tax under default tax regime u/s 115BAC, then ` 3,00,000 is the basic exemption limit irrespective of the age of the person. If such person has exercised the option to shift out of the default tax regime, then, the basic exemption limit would be ` 5,00,000 for resident individuals of the age of 80 years or more at any time during the previous year, ` 3,00,000 for resident individuals of the age of 60 years or more (but less than 80 years) at any time during the previous year and ` 2,50,000 for all others). Only if non-agricultural income exceeds this limit, partial integration would be required.\\n\\nIt may be noted that aggregation provisions do not apply to company, LLP, firm, co-operative society and local authority. The object of aggregating the net agricultural income with non-agricultural income is to tax the non-agricultural income at higher rates.\\n\\nTax calculation in such cases is as follows:\\n\\nStep 1: Add non-agricultural income with net agricultural income.

Thus, co-executors or co-trustees are assessable as a BOI as their title and interest are indivisible.\\n\\nThe difference between an AOP and BOI is that in case of a BOI, only individuals can be the members, whereas in case of AOP, any person can be its member i.e. entities like company, firm etc. can be the member of AOP but not of BOI.
